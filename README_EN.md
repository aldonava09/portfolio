# Project: Portfolio

This project is a portfolio that has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the popular framework REACT. The BEM methodology has been applied both in the file structure and class naming. REACT is used to divide the code into components, both in JS and CSS, making it more organized and easy to update with new components and maintain.

## Key Features

- **HTML, CSS and JavaScript:** The project has been developed using standard web programming languages: HTML for the structure, CSS for the design, and JavaScript with REACT.

- **Components:** The code has been divided into reusable components, making maintenance and scalability of the project easier.

- **BEM Methodology:** The BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology has been applied for class naming, helping to maintain more readable and structured code.

- **Active validations:** Active validations have been implemented for all form fields. This means real-time checks are performed to ensure that user-entered data is correct and meets the established requirements.

## Installation and Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/aldonava09/Project-Social-Network.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Open a terminal in the project's root folder.
4. Run the following command to install the dependencies: `npm install`
5. Run the following command to compile and run the project in development mode: `npm run start`
6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## REACT Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
